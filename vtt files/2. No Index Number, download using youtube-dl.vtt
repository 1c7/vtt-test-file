Hi I’m John Green and this is Crash Course
European History.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.540
Last time, we looked at how the monarchs did--and
didn’t--incorporate the ideas of the Enlightenment

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.269
into their domestic policies.

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.520
Today, we’ll look outward to how the 18th
century European powers engaged with each

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.039
other and beyond Europe--which is to say that
warfare is coming.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.880
Or, continuing, I suppose, because it never
really left town.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:37.719
[Intro]
So, population was rising in 18th century

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:44.210
Europe and despite an extremely uneven distribution
of wealth and lots of wartime casualties,

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.600
many people were leading better lives.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.680
For example, inventories of French people’s
possessions show that in 1700 women owned

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.039
an average of two garments generally in solid
black or brown;

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.960
in 1800 that number was five garments of more
varied, even bright colors.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.140
Now, this may seem like minor progress, but
here’s another way of thinking about it:
