00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.540
Hi I’m John Green and this is Crash Course
European History.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.540
Last time, we looked at how the monarchs did--and
didn’t--incorporate the ideas of the Enlightenment

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.269
into their domestic policies.

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.520
Today, we’ll look outward to how the 18th
century European powers engaged with each

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.039
other and beyond Europe--which is to say that
warfare is coming.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.880
Or, continuing, I suppose, because it never
really left town.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:37.719
[Intro]
So, population was rising in 18th century

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:44.210
Europe and despite an extremely uneven distribution
of wealth and lots of wartime casualties,

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.600
many people were leading better lives.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.680
For example, inventories of French people’s
possessions show that in 1700 women owned

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.039
an average of two garments generally in solid
black or brown;

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.960
in 1800 that number was five garments of more
varied, even bright colors.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.140
Now, this may seem like minor progress, but
here’s another way of thinking about it:

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.220
The average number of garments owned by people
living in France rose by more in a hundred

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.360
years than it had in the previous hundred
thousand.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.010
By the way, did that dress look gold to you,
or blue?

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.510
And do you even remember that meme?

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.510
Probably not.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.510
Oh god, I’m so old.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.630
I grow old, I grow old, I shall wear the bottoms
of my trousers rolled.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.560
That’s an even older meme.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.870
At any rate, we associate these and many other
improving conditions in Europe with what is

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.630
called “modernity”—an idea combining
improvement and novelty that we will examine

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.700
later in the series.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.160
But when it came to warfare, Europeans were
still battling it out among themselves on

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.580
the continent and on the seas--and always
at great cost.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.240
The 18th century opened with wars of the Spanish,
Polish, and Austrian successions, all of which

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.140
were just what their names suggest: fights
over who was going to become king or queen

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.310
amidst a dispute over rulership—disputes
not unlike the one at the heart of the Hundred

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.570
Years War.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.610
And so in that sense, progress had been . . . minimal.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.130
As far as wars between states, the dominant
idea in foreign relations was still to grab

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.220
as much territory as possible from foreign
kingdoms.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.980
Because only by making your kingdom bigger
could you also make it richer.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.630
So for instance as Austria fought with itself
during its war of succession over whether

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.590
a woman, Maria Theresa, should be allowed
to ascend to the Habsburg throne, Frederick

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.060
the Great of neighboring Prussia quickly mobilized
his army and seized Silesia from the Habsburgs.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.260
When I read the phrase, “seized Silesia”
it rolled right off the tongue of my mind,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.260
but man.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.390
Saying it is a completely different matter.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.510
At any rate, Maria Theresa’s rulership survived,
but Habsburg control of Silesia did not.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.290
Because of economic globalization, still other
wars aimed at controlling trade routes and

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.290
productive territory around the world.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.569
For that reason sometimes a cluster of wars
in the middle of the eighteenth century has

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.280
been called a “world war” or the Great
War for Empire.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.670
Like, it was a world war, but unfortunately
we already have a World War I, so we’re

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.150
in a bit of a tight spot, name-wise.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.440
But these wars did occur across truly global
battlefields and oceans.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.990
They included wars between the British and
local Native American peoples (sometimes called

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.850
the first and second Anglo-Indian Wars), and
also the French and Indian War in North America.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.600
and there was also the Seven Years War, which
was fought partly within Europe, but there

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.010
were also battles between Britain and its
rivals—most notably France and Spain—in

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.190
the Caribbean, the Philippines, and India.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.990
In this complicated and many-tentacled set
of wars—or arguably a single war in many

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.220
different theaters—the French and British
were ultimately fighting over who would be

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.600
the dominant European force in the wider world.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.180
Spain was a somewhat smaller player, fighting
to protect its holdings in the Caribbean and

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.320
the Philippines.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.310
Native people around the world were enlisted
in these struggles, and local peoples changed

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.790
sides often as their interests shifted, and
in the end trusted none of the Europeans,

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.550
who pitted native peoples against each other
and also were not known for keeping their

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:13.550
promises.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.299
Simultaneously the Russians were waging war
against the Ottomans in eastern Europe, the

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.570
Mediterranean, the Middle East, and the Caucasus.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.600
In Russia, like in the other European kingdoms,
the wars’ costs were passed on mostly to

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.260
ordinary people, who faced more efficient
and demanding tax collection.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.200
Additionally, central governments were disrupting
local traditions and practices--for instance,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.450
local traditions related to the consumption
of alcohol were disrupted in Russia by HUGE

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.440
increases in taxes on alcohol.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.090
Did the center of the world just open?

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.080
Is my favorite book, The Bear and the Dragon
in there?

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.730
Ah, The Bear and the Dragon by Tom Clancy.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:57.330
I’ve never actually read it, but inside
my copy of the bear and the dragon is this.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:04.630
So in 18th century Russia, this huge tax on
alcohol eventually funded 22% of the empire’s

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.030
total budget.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.210
And there were other disruptions as well,
arguably more important ones, including the

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.699
conversion of some free peasants into serfs.

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.310
Local people fought back in a variety of ways.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.169
The first of the extensive uprisings against
the efficient and “enlightened” taxation

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.260
to pay for warfare was the Pugachev Rebellion.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.390
It was led by former Cossack and Russian army
deserter Emile Pugachev.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:35.780
He managed to persuade rural Russians that
he was in fact Peter III, husband of Catherine

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:36.780
II.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:43.030
Now, Peter had been assassinated in 1762 within
months of his accession to power, most likely

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.630
at Catherine’s command (and possibly by
her lover).

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:52.410
So given that Russian history really was playing
out like a soap opera, it didn’t seem impossible

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.490
that the murdered Czar had been hiding out
all along as a Russian army deserter named

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.490
Emile.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.190
Pugachev claimed to have wandered poor and
alone like Jesus until he could become the

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.320
“Tsar Redeemer.”

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.630
And as Peter III, Pugachev created quite the
following.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.160
He had Russian clergy and officials—both
high and low—issue a series of measures

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.350
relieving serfs of their burdens.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.680
Pugachev also roused the Cossacks, who were
fearful of being forced into the army and

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.130
losing their freedom.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.510
He confirmed their rights and liberties and
he granted everyone permission to sport beards,

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.639
which, as you may recall, Peter I had outlawed.

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:35.760
And some three million Russians followed Pugachev
until he was captured in 1774, then gruesomely

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.450
tortured and executed in January 1775.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.220
After that, Catherine again tightened the
nobility’s grip on serfs.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.170
Hard on the heels of Pugachev’s uprising,
the American Revolution erupted over a series

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:54.050
of taxes Britain imposed on its thirteen colonies
in North America—again to pay the costs

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.550
of imperial warfare.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.720
Now, the British government felt that the
expense it had incurred in defeating the French

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.100
and Native Americans in the French and Indian
War should be paid by the colonists who’d

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.610
profited from the protection.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.060
But in America, we don’t stand for that
kind of reasoning!

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.330
There were some other things going on.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:17.320
The royal government had also closed off westward
expansion at the Allegheny Mountains, which

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.650
in effect eradicated the property rights of
people like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.430
who claimed land there.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:29.360
And King George agreed with his advisors that
the Americans were rough, stupid, and ineffective,

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.690
especially as miltary people.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.889
So to keep the Native Americans under control,
a standing army of British soldiers should

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:40.990
be stationed on the North American continent
and financed by the colonists.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:46.600
So if history is all about shifting perspectives,
we’re gonna shift perspectives quickly here.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:54.259
From the british perspective, American colonists
were taxed 1 shilling for every 26 paid by

00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:58.139
a homeland Briton, and that seemed like a
pretty good deal.

00:07:58.139 --> 00:08:02.860
But from the perspective of the North American
colonists, they did not have the rights of

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.880
other Englishmen, including the right not
to be taxed without representation.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.210
Colonists created a Declaration of Independence,
which was issued in 1776.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:18.009
The British the sent additional troops, and
soon war erupted.

00:08:18.009 --> 00:08:22.850
Those who wanted independence harassed, beat
up, murdered and destroyed the property of

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.800
the loyalists, who responded in kind.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.850
The rebels were greatly aided by the Spanish
and French who sent decisive aid in the form

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.630
of ships and military personnel.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:38.159
And besides, the British had other concerns,
including preserving their far more lucrative

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:43.550
sugar islands in the Caribbean, as well as
their holdings in India, and in Canada.

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:47.610
Although comparatively insignificant at the
time, the newly independent colonies that

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:52.709
became the United States established a representative
form of government with a written constitution

00:08:52.709 --> 00:08:55.069
that featured many Enlightenment principles.

00:08:55.069 --> 00:09:01.410
Now, it was hardly a true democracy, as only
a minority had any legal say or rights and

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.389
the Constitution itself enshrined slavery.

00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:07.620
But it also definitely wasn’t a monarchy.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.339
Anyway, this little country would eventually
grow big enough for us to make an entire Crash

00:09:11.339 --> 00:09:12.459
Course about it.

00:09:12.459 --> 00:09:16.589
Meanwhile, the defeated loyalists, including
slaves who had been promised their freedom

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:21.380
in return for fighting for the crown, fled
to Canada and other parts of the world.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:26.140
And for the record, they rarely received the
financial support that the British had promised

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.129
them for their faithful assistance.

00:09:28.129 --> 00:09:32.540
Spain also saw uprisings against the reforms
of the enlightened monarchs, though grievances

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:37.559
had been piling up even before efficient and
tax-heavy policies were put in place.

00:09:37.559 --> 00:09:42.970
Also, Spain lost Manila in the Philippines
to the British, and they lost Florida, which,

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.000
you know, not exactly a tragedy.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.980
I am a Floridan so I am allowed to make that
joke.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.360
And, that’s not fair.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.509
Florida is lovely.

00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:55.851
It really is the best place in the United
States to run from your past mistakes, straight

00:09:55.851 --> 00:09:57.100
into new ones.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.160
But back to Spain.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.170
So, across the occupied Spanish lands in the
Western Hemisphere, local people found ways

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:08.100
to express their discontent with colonial
oppression, at times violently protesting

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:12.670
injustices by imperial officials or overbearing
behavior by priests.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:18.339
Religious activists claimed that the Spanish
were false gods; in the former Incan lands,

00:10:18.339 --> 00:10:22.839
several Incans actively opposed the Spanish
government in a concerted uprising that began

00:10:22.839 --> 00:10:25.850
in 1742, but was soon defeated.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.360
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.360
1.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.670
In 1780, another uprising battling Spanish
rule broke out in the Andes.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:32.670
2.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.980
Inca Tupac Ameru led a powerful rebellion
against Spanish authorities in an attempt

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.129
to restore the former Incan empire

00:10:39.129 --> 00:10:44.629
3. and to liberate local people from the increased
Spanish demands for labor and taxes.

00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:45.629
4.

00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:47.670
His wife Michaela Bastidas, who was part Incan,

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:52.929
5. was operational manager and chief enforcer
of loyalty to her husband’s uprising.

00:10:52.929 --> 00:10:53.929
6.

00:10:53.929 --> 00:10:55.399
In that role she was especially brutal.

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:56.399
7.

00:10:56.399 --> 00:11:00.629
She threatened slackers, even her husband,
whom she chastised for following losing strategies.

00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:01.629
8.

00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:05.279
And she ensured that the revolt’s soldiers
were supplied with arms and food and that

00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:06.459
they were paid

00:11:06.459 --> 00:11:09.740
9. —concerns that Tupac Ameru seemed to
forget sometimes.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.740
10.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.319
Alongside Bastidas, who mostly directed military
activity,

00:11:13.319 --> 00:11:14.319
11.

00:11:14.319 --> 00:11:18.509
entire units of women soldiers took to the
battlefields in several parts of the empire,

00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:20.480
building on traditions of active resistance.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.480
12.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.290
Spanish soldiers noticed them for their intense
commitment to victory in battle,

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.290
13.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:30.529
calling them “supermasculine” and one
fighter in particular “as bloody a butcher

00:11:30.529 --> 00:11:31.589
as her brother.”

00:11:31.589 --> 00:11:32.589
14.

00:11:32.589 --> 00:11:37.380
The rebellion was put down with focused determination
and its leaders were eventually captured.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.380
15.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:43.379
In 1781, the Spanish colonial government (in
present day Peru) had Michaela Bastidas dragged

00:11:43.379 --> 00:11:47.639
bound hand and foot to her execution, garroted,
then hanged;

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:48.639
16.

00:11:48.639 --> 00:11:52.739
finally they cut her body to pieces with her
head posted on a pike for all to see.

00:11:52.739 --> 00:11:53.739
17.

00:11:53.739 --> 00:11:56.829
Which, unfortunately is not the last time
we’re going to be talking about heads on

00:11:56.829 --> 00:11:58.959
pikes in Crash Course European History.

00:11:58.959 --> 00:11:59.959
18.

00:11:59.959 --> 00:12:02.970
Her husband’s execution and mutilation followed
shortly thereafter.

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.079
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:09.629
Some 100,000 people died in the uprisings
in the Spanish empire—that is, around ten

00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:14.529
percent of the native population in all of
Spain’s South American holdings.

00:12:14.529 --> 00:12:19.360
The Spanish imperial government prevailed
whereas the British did not for a number of

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.360
reasons.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.320
For one, the Spanish administration was less
dispersed in its efforts and had seen how

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.980
Britain suffered because it was fighting all
around the world.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:33.249
Also, Spain had also begun the process of
integrating creoles—people of Spanish descent

00:12:33.249 --> 00:12:38.509
born in the colonies—into the officer corps
of the Spanish imperial armies.

00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:43.519
Professional training, access to military
schools and military privileges all served

00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:45.809
to build loyalty to Spain.

00:12:45.809 --> 00:12:49.110
And that was essentially the opposite of British
treatment and attitudes towards North American

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:50.110
colonials.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:55.699
Britain saw its North American colonials as,
like, useless at fighting and hopeless as

00:12:55.699 --> 00:12:56.699
officers.

00:12:56.699 --> 00:13:00.899
and so the Spanish Empire in the Americas
survived for now.

00:13:00.899 --> 00:13:03.689
Still, some saw a different outcome.

00:13:03.689 --> 00:13:08.329
Francisco de Miranda, a creole official in
the Spanish army, helped achieved the victory

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:11.230
for the American Revolutionaries at Yorktown.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:16.639
He watched the Spanish dealings with the rebels
in Peru, observing “how astute and perfidious

00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:18.930
the Spanish agents had proved.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.670
. . .”
But Miranda predicted, “the Anglo-American

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:22.670
colonies.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.670
. . independence.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:27.529
. .was bound to be . . . the infallible preliminary
to our own.”

00:13:27.529 --> 00:13:32.139
And indeed, people of South America had greater
battles to come as they continued to fight

00:13:32.139 --> 00:13:33.730
for their freedom from Spain.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:37.429
So, these eighteenth century wars had many
long-term outcomes.

00:13:37.429 --> 00:13:42.299
First, as the Seven Years War unwound and
the Prussian army built itself up, Frederick

00:13:42.299 --> 00:13:47.839
the Great saw a chance to cut up Poland-Lithuania,
proposing to divide a good chunk of it among

00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:50.759
Austria, Russia, and Prussia itself.

00:13:50.759 --> 00:13:56.430
This was the First Partition of Poland; so-called
because further partitions would follow.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:01.199
Meanwhile, while Britain lost what it thought
of as a less lucrative part of its empire,

00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:06.249
it kept its domination of the Caribbean sugar
islands and turned its attention to extracting

00:14:06.249 --> 00:14:07.869
the wealth of India.

00:14:07.869 --> 00:14:12.059
Finally, after providing the crucial aide
that allowed the birth of the United States

00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:18.189
of America, France was in dire financial straits
and badly in need of reform.

00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:22.399
As the French watched, and supported, the
emergence of a nation without a monarch across

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:28.630
the Atlantic, few of them could have imagined
that a great revolution was just one episode

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:34.360
away that would see the French monarchy beheaded--both
literally and figuratively.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.360
Thanks for watching.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:54.540
I’ll see you then.
