# VTT Test File
Here is a bunch of `.vtt` file.    
All of them follow this specification: [WebVTT: The Web Video Text Tracks Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1/)

## Purpose
Testing


## Why I created this
I built a Desktop app called [Tern - Subtitle File Translator](http://tern.1c7.me/)  
It can read .srt .ass .vtt and translate them into another langauge.  
It's like a `Google Translator Toolkit` replacement

I have to parse `.vtt` file.  
To make sure my program work with all kind of `.vtt` file.     
I create/collected these file for testing.  

I open source it so everyone can save time.
